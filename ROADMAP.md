# Firecash roadmap

This roadmap captures the next steps to move Firecash from a template into a daily-use money manager.

## Now (foundation)
- ✅ Create accounts, account groups, and transactions from the UI (API-backed).
- ✅ Use real-time defaults (current dates/ranges) for dashboards and transaction entry.

## Next (core money management)
- Budgets by category (monthly/weekly), including alerts when thresholds are exceeded.
- Transaction categories + merchant labeling, with bulk edit support.
- Import/export tools (CSV/OFX) for transaction history.
- Account group membership management in the UI (read + update).
- Recurring transaction creation and editing workflows.

## Later (insights + automation)
- Reports: spending by category, cashflow trends, and net worth projections.
- Asset performance tracking with refresh scheduling and price sources.
- Savings goals and progress tracking.
- Notification center (email/webhooks) for large transactions or budget overages.

## Long-term (polish + ecosystem)
- API keys and read-only access tokens for integrations.
- Mobile-friendly dashboard views.
- Audit log and data export for compliance.
